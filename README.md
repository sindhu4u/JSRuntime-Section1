# JavaScript Runner with Rust and Deno

This project demonstrates how to run a JavaScript file using Rust and the Deno runtime. It leverages the `deno_core` crate to load and execute ES modules in an asynchronous runtime, providing a basic setup for running JavaScript in a Rust environment.

- Uses the Deno core for JavaScript execution.
- Loads and evaluates ES modules.
- Runs JavaScript files asynchronously with Rust's Tokio runtime.
